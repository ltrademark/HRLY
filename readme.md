<h1 align="center">HRLY</h1>

HRLY (Hourly) is a minimalist hourly chime app designed to help you keep track of time without constantly checking your phone. It uses a simple system of long and short tones to signify the hour, running quietly in the background.

## How It Works

The app uses a combination of two sounds to represent the time:
*   **1 short tone** = 1 hour
*   **1 long tone** = 5 hours

These tones compound to announce the current hour. For example, 7:00 will be announced with one long tone and two short tones.

## Features

*   **Simple Time System:** Easily learn the time-telling system.
*   **Customizable Sounds:** Use your own audio files for both the short and long tones.
*   **Notification Controls:** Skip the next chime or stop the service directly from the notification.
*   **Background Service:** Runs efficiently in the background to chime on the hour.
*   **Optional Visual Pulse:** An optional visual pulse can accompany the chime on the lock screen. (Still working out some kinks)
*   **User Control:** Easily enable or disable the main chime service, visuals, and custom sounds.
*   **Minimalist Design:** A clean, no-frills interface.
*   **Open Source:** A "View Source" button provides a quick link to the project's GitHub page.
