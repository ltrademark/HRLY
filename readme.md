HRLY (Hourly) is a minimalist hourly chime app designed to help you keep track of time without constantly checking your phone. It uses a simple system of long and short tones to signify the hour, running quietly in the background.

## How It Works

The app uses a combination of two sounds to represent the time:
*   **1 short tone** = 1 hour
*   **1 long tone** = 5 hours

These tones compound to announce the current hour. For example, 7:00 will be announced with one long tone and two short tones.
